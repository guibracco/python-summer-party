Every daily challenge was presented as a quick 3-questions analysis[^note] of a small dataset, designed to mock one of known real business and divided by the publishers into easy, medium and hard categories. Instead of a big and complex coding project, the goal was to solve the tasks proposed using either NumPy and/or Pandas.

This repo reproduces all of the 15 days of coding challenges with their original data.

[^note]: Day 12 had only 2 questions
